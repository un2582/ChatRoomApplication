# ChatRoomApplication
Uses Java socket programming. This project was done using IntelliJ. In order to run the program, first run the server first which is in the file marked "ChatServerProject" and then run as many instances of the "ClientProject" as you wish. Input your name into the client project and then input anything you wish to type in. All instances of chatting will be shown on the server side as an output. Remember, if you wish to run multiple instances of the "ClientProject" without starting up multiple intellij, 1. go to main tab on the top right corner, 2. click on edit configurations, 3. click on the tab that says "allow parallel run" on the top right corner, then click apply. Now you can run as many main instances of the client side as you want so that you can have multiple people sending their inputs to the server side. Or, if you don't wish to edit these configurations, you can simply start up multiple instances of intellij and then run main that way.
